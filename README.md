## What are the "ads.txt" and "app-ads.txt" Projects?
The mission of these projects is simple: Increase transparency in the programmatic advertising ecosystem. "ads.txt" stands for Authorized Digital Sellers and is a simple, flexible and secure method that publishers and distributors can use to publicly declare the companies they authorize to sell their digital inventory.
By creating a public record of Authorized Digital Sellers, "ads.txt" and "app-ads.txt" will create greater transparency in the inventory supply chain and give publishers control over their inventory in the market, making it harder for bad actors to profit from selling counterfeit inventory across the ecosystem. As publishers adopt "ads.txt", buyers will be able to more easily identify the Authorized Digital Sellers for a participating publisher, allowing brands to have confidence they are buying authentic publisher inventory.


## What is "ads.txt"?
"ads.txt" is a simple, flexible, and secure method for publishers and distributors to declare who is authorized to sell their inventory, improving transparency for programmatic buyers.
"ads.txt" supports transparent programmatic digital media transactions and can remove the financial incentive from selling counterfeit and misrepresented media. Similar to robots.txt, "ads.txt" can only be posted to a domain by a publisher’s webmaster, making it valid and authentic. As a text file, "ads.txt" is easy to update, making it flexible. The data required to populate the file is readily available in the OpenRTB protocol, making it simple to gather and target. And because publishers sell their inventory through a variety of sales channels, "ads.txt" supports the following types of supplier relationships:
• Domain owners who sell on exchanges through their own accounts • Networks and sales houses who programmatically sell on behalf of domain owners • Content syndication partnerships where multiple authorized sellers represent the same inventory

## What is "app-ads.txt"?
The "app-ads.txt" specification is an extension of the original "ads.txt" standard to meet the requirements for applications distributed through mobile app stores, connected television app stores, or other application distribution channels. "ads.txt" is a text file app developer upload to their developer website, which lists the ad sources authorized to sell that developer’s inventory. Just like on web, the IAB created a system which allows buyers to know who is authorized to buy and sell specific in-app ad inventory, and who isn’t.

## What problem does "ads.txt" and "ads.txt" Solve?
The "ads.txt" project aims to prevent various types of counterfeit inventory across the ecosystem by improving transparency in the digital programmatic supply chain. When a brand advertiser buys media programmatically, they rely on the fact that the URLs they purchase were legitimately sold by those publishers. The problem is, there is currently no way for a buyer to confirm who is responsible for selling those impressions across exchanges, and there are many different scenarios when the URL passed may not be an accurate representation of what the impression actually is or who is selling it. While every impression already includes publisher information from the OpenRTB protocol, including the page URL and Publisher.ID, there is no record or information confirming who owns each Publisher.ID, nor any way to confirm the validity of the information sent in the RTB bid request, leaving the door open to counterfeit inventory.

Counterfeit inventory – is defined here as a unit of inventory sourced from a domain, app or video that is intentionally mislabeled and offered for sale a different domain, app or video. The motivation to create counterfeit inventory comes in many forms including, to sell invalid traffic (automated non-human, or incentivised/mislead human traffic) by hiding it in real traffic, to attract higher prices by mislabeling inventory as brand inventory, to bypass content or domain blacklists, or to capture advertising spend restricted to whitelisted domains, among others.

Note that this form of “inventory fraud” in advertising is independent of how the traffic is generated. It can potentially include a mix of for example automated (non-human) bot traffic and real human user traffic. It can also exist as a small amount of authentic and valid inventory mixed with mislabeled inventory.

## HOW DOES "ads.txt" WORK?
"ads.txt" works by creating a publicly accessible record of authorized digital sellers for publisher inventory that programmatic buyers can index and reference if they wish to purchase inventory from authorized sellers. First, participating publishers must post their list of authorized sellers to their domain. Programmatic buyers can then crawl the web for publisher "ads.txt" files to create a list of authorized sellers for each participating publisher. Then programmatic buyers can create a filter to match their "ads.txt" list against the data provided in the OpenRTB bid request.

Example: Example.com publishes "ads.txt" on their web server listing three exchanges as authorized to sell their inventory, including Example.com’s seller account IDs within each of those exchanges.

http://example.com/ads.txt: #< SSP/Exchange Domain >, < SellerAccountID >, < PaymentsType >, < TAGID > greenadexchange.com, 12345, DIRECT, AEC242 blueadexchange.com, 4536, DIRECT silverssp.com, 9675, RESELLER
Note: The seller’s Publisher.ID will be specified in the “SellerAccountID” field in the "ads.txt". A buyer receiving a bid request claiming to be example.com can verify if the exchange and SellerAccountID matches the authorized sellers listed in example.com/"ads.txt" file.

## WHERE TO IMPLEMENT "ads.txt"?
Save the file with the name "ads.txt", and upload it to the root folder of your domain, such as example.com/ads.txt
Please implement the following "ads.txt"
https://github.com/spring-media/adsolutions-ads.txt/blob/master/{YOUR ADVERTISER}/ads.txt
e.g._ https://github.com/spring-media/adsolutions-ads.txt/blob/master/MediaImpact/ads.txt


## HOW DOES "app-ads.txt" WORK?
"ads.txt" introduces a mechanism for identifying sellers authorized to sell an app’s inventory by listing the developers’ website on the app listing page in all stores where the app is sold. Crawlers can then use this information to locate the app’s "app-ads.txt" file and validate the seller’s authorization.

To better understand this process, let’s use Mountain Panda, a fictional gaming app, as an example. Mountain Panda is developed by GoGoGames, and their developer site is gogogames.com. GoGoGames uses SpotX as their programmatic partner and sells their inventory through SpotX. GoGoGames’ Publisher ID in SpotX is 123456, and SpotX’s TAGID is 7842df1d2fe2db34. GoGoGames would host their "app-ads.txt" file at gogogames.com/"app-ads.txt", and the file would include the following information:

#ads.txt gogogames.com
spotx.tv, 123456, DIRECT, 7842df1d2fe2db34

So far, this should sound pretty familiar to how "ads.txt" works, but things diverge slightly when it comes to how the location of the "app-ads.txt" file is determined. With "ads.txt" for mobile web or desktop traffic, the site URL in the ad or bid request is used to locate the seller’s "ads.txt" file. Whereas with "app-ads.txt", there are a couple more steps to find the sellers "app-ads.txt" file, starting with the app store URL included in the ad or bid request. 

To better understand how the location of the "app-ads.txt" is determined, let’s go back to our Mountain Panda app example. When an SSP or DSP receives an ad or bid request originating from the Mountain Panda app, the SSP or DSP will use the provided app store URL to locate the app listing on the app store.  The app listing includes various information about the app, including the developer and their developer site. The entity looking to validate the seller would then be able to visit gogogames.com/"app-ads.txt" to view the list of authorized sellers. If the seller is listed, the entity can consider the impression authorized.

## WHERE AND HOW TO IMPLEMENT "app-ads.txt"?
1.	Provide a developer website in your app store listings. Ensure that the proper developer website URL is accessible in the developer website section of the app store. (Already exists for most of our apps)

2.	Create an "app-ads.txt" file and include the following data: - Ad Source domain, Publisher ID, Type of relationship, Ad Source ID. For Media Impact, this list of trusted partners can dynamically be found here :-  https://github.com/spring-media/adsolutions-ads.txt/blob/master/MediaImpact/app-ads.txt

3.	Publish the "app-ads.txt" file in the root folder of the app developer’s developer website; for example, www.myappsite.com/app-ads.txt. This is very similar to how we implemented it for "ads.txt" for web.
